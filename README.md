# MusicPlayer

I have create this lite music player with simple GUI interface for everyone. 
I wanted to implement fast access to library as well as Now Playing playlist so I've used ViewPager to create two fragments and achieved this idea of mine.
Also I've used [SeekArc Library](https://github.com/neild001/SeekArc) to give it a little cool look that user can enjoy.
